## 🚀 About the Project

This project is a fun and interactive Streamlit-based web app that uses **Logistic Regression** and **Random Forest** models to predict whether a given timeline leads to **Victory** or **Defeat** based on various input parameters. Inspired by the Marvel Cinematic Universe, it puts you in charge of simulating multiversal outcomes using strategic features.
